(This quick reference document can help you assess whether an organization is truly adopting agile values and methodologies, or is simply using agile as a buzzword.)

“*The purpose of the change enablement practice is to maximize the number of successful IT changes by ensuring that risks have been properly assessed, authorizing changes to proceed, and managing the change schedule.*”

Change enablement, as opposed to organizational change management, usually focuses on changes in products and services.</br>
Three types of change are each managed in different ways i.e. **standard**, **normal** and **emergency** changes.

The change authority is defined as a person or group who authorizes a change.
Communication and coordination is essential to ensure that changes are implemented in an efficient manner… consider how all/any teams/workstreams may be affected and act/inform accordingly.

### Types of Change
* Mission & Strategy
* Organizational Structure
* People
* Culture
* Policies & Legal Agreements
* Processes
* Technology
* Product Updates

Anything high/higher risk that needs planning will go into the ITIL change management process.

### Documentation

Include overview, contact info, backup plan, people & systems impacted

Evaluate the Change - practical? What is the priority?

Approve/authorize the change

Coordinate Implementation (responsibility of the change manager)

Post-mortem - review & close change request

* **Change initiator** - identifies requirement for change
* **Change coordinator**  - analyzes request
* **Change manager** - manages requests
* **Change advisory board** - authorizes requests
* **Approver** - approves request
* **Specialists** - processes request
