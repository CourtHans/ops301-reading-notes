Most common topology is **star topology**.
Major benefits are that if one computer failed, the others would not be affected. However, the disadvantage is that if the central hub fails, the entire network goes down (SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE).

**Ring topology** </br>
Old, and rarely used. Easy to install and troubleshoot, but if there is a SINGLE break, than all data flow would be disrupted.

**Bus topology** </br>
Old, not used much anymore. All are connected to a single cable. Advantages are that it's fairly cheap, but the cable must be terminated on both ends and there must not be ANY open connections. Signal reflection could disrupt data flow.

**Mesh topology** </br>
Lots of connections, so it handles disruption very well. The advantage is that it creates a high redundancy level; however, there's a huge amount of cabling and network cards so it can be cost prohibitive. The internet uses mesh topology.

**Wireless topology** </br>
Similar to a star topology. Wireless access point acts as a bridge.
