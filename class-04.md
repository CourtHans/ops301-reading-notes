### Article
***"Tunneling is the process of encrypting data and keeping it separate from other traffic on the internet."***</br>

Two processes at play: encapsulation (disguise) and encryption (protection). 

There is no "one size fits all" VPN - each type will offer features, and you have to consider your use case(s) to determine the best VPN fit.

"*A **kill switch** is a mechanism setup to regularly monitor your connection for any changes in status.*"

Split tunneling can allow access to web services where you want or need the protection of tunneling, without losing direct access to local web services.

**Questions to ask yourself:**</br>
* How fast is it?
* How secure is it?
* How easily can it transverse blocking software?
* How easily can I access and use it?

**Commonly used protocols:**</br>
1. Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)
2. Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (L2TP)
3. Internet Protocol Security (IPSec)
4. Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol (SSTP) - "the most secure VPN protocol available by default in Windows operating systems"
5. Open VPN (SSL/TLS) - "OpenVPN is fast and capable of traversing VPN-blocking software. Because of the open source nature of the protocol, security experts have been regularly combing it for potential security flaws and making improvements, boosting user confidence in the protocol."

A VPN is an encrypted connection from one LAN to another, allowing secure connection over the internet. The internet itself is unsecure, so if you're transferring data, a VPN provides a secure tunnel to send it through. It's also critical for secure connections for travelling workers, people working from home, and mobile devices. </br>
There are two types of VPN - Site-to-Site VPN and Remote Access VPN
