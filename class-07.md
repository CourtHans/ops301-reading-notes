### Network Segmentation

DAAS - data, application, asset, or services

The element of trust used to be an invisible guiding hand in security infrastructure, but less so now. Users can be either unwitting or knowing accomplices to malicious threats to the CIA triad of an organization's network. 

"Because of the inherent weaknesses of assumed trust, many organizations have begun to adopt the Zero Trust strategy. Zero Trust assumes nobody is trustworthy by default, even those already inside the network perimeter."

"Microperimeters, whether physical or virtual, prevent threats from moving laterally within the network, essentially negating much of the work that went into creating [an] initial breach."

"How you decide to segment your network is called a segmentation policy." </br>
"Today, software-defined access technology simplifies segmentation by grouping and tagging network traffic. It then uses traffic tags to enforce segmentation policy directly on the network equipment, yet without the complexity of traditional approaches."

### Benefits

* Improve operational performance
* Limit cyberattack damage
* Protect vulnerable devices
* Reduce the scope of compliance

Networking devices have two functional planes of operation:
1. control plane
2. data plane

Software defined networking (SDN) is directly programmable, agile and centrally managed.

It can be programmatically configured (w/o human intervention). It is vendor neutral which leaves a lot more flexibility. 

Distributed switching allows you to remove the physical segmentation, again, giving more flexibilty/elasticity.
