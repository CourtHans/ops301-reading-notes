### DevOps

**Reading**
* [What is DevOps? A Basic Introduction](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/devops-basics-introduction/)
* [An Introduction to Infrastructure As Code](https://geekflare.com/infrastructure-as-code-intro/)

> ***"DevOps has one primary initiative to achieve: continuous integration to continuous delivery.***

There are four key principles of DevOps
* Continuous integration (CI)
* Continuous delivery (CD)
* Continuous testing
* Continuous monitoring

DevOps focuses on speed, resourcesfullness, and customer satisfaction.

R&Rs in DevOps
* DevOps or Platform Engineer
* Build Engineer
* Reliability Engineer
* Release Manager
* Data Analyst
* Product Manager

DevOps requires a lot of trust, a lot of communication, and total buy-in; however, if these things exist, the potential for continuously high customer satisfaction is fantastic!

> "Capturing the steps required to deploy or terminate instances and other infrastructure components in code enables automation."

IaC - infrastructure as code</br>
"The idea is that you treat your infrastructure like software and then write, test, and execute code to define, deploy, update, and destroy your infrastructure."

*Idempotency* - "Being idempotent means you define the desired state, and no matter how many times you run the script, the result is the same. It checks the current state and the desired state and only applies the changes which are needed. This can be extremely difficult to achieve with bash scripts."

**Benefits**
* Self-service
* Idempotency (see above)
* Reduced costs
* Faster software delivery
* Self Documenting
* Version controlled
* Validation and testing
* Improved security
