### Database Administration

**Reading**
* [What is a Database? What is SQL?](https://www.guru99.com/introduction-to-database-sql.html)

A database supports the electronic storage and manipulation of data.  

"**SQL** (structured query language) is the standard language for dealing with Relational Databases. SQL can be used to insert, search, update, and delete database records." SQL can also maintain and optimize databases.

**DBMS** - database management system

Types of DBMS:
* Hierarhical DBMS
* Network DBMS
* Relational DBMS
* Object oriented DMBS

Hierarchical DBMS (employes parent/child relationship) - now rarely used</br>
Network DBMS (supports many to many) - RDM server is an example</br>
Relational DBMS (uses tables) - usually have predefined data types. The most popular in the market (mySQL, Oracle)</br>
Object oriented DBMS (data is in teh form of objects)

SQL is the standard language for dealing with relational databases.  Relational databases use SQL syntax (some DBs use proprietary syntax). "The most widely used DBMS is the relational model that saves data in table formats. It uses SQL as the standard query language."

"**NoSQL** is an upcoming category of Database Management Systems. Its main characteristic is its non-adherence to Relational Database Concepts." It means "not only SQL." "NoSQL database is non-relational databases that scale-out better than relational databases and are designed with web applications in mind."

ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
