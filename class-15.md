> "The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that employment of computer and information-technology occupations will grow by 12% between 2014 and 2024, faster than the average for any other occupation."

A cycle really kicked off in the '80s that led to decreased consumer confidence in the computer gaming industry. Advertisers "sold games to boys because boys were the ones buying them, and boys were the ones buying them because of the advertisers’ targeted marketing."  

"An American Association of University Women review of more than 380 studies from academic journals, corporations, and government sources found that more early exposure to engineering and computing among boys in school creates 'more positive attitudes toward and interest in STEM subjects.'" Compounding the experience gap is the male-dominated environment that has arisen - one that can become a challenging, and sometimes seemingly insurmountable obstacle.

The 2017 article concluded with this thought:</br>
"It is clear that the advertising narrative around women and technology needs to be more inclusive if the gender gap is going to close. Until that happens, as Ames argues, advertising will continue to drive 'a subtle message to girls and women that it’s not a place where they belong.'”

The data in [Employee breakdown of key technology companies](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/diversity-in-tech/) demonstrates we still have a LONG way to go to diversify the tech industry...not a huge amount of movement in the years the breakdown covers.

***Diverse teams are smarter and more creative.*** When you collect a disparate point of view, you're far less likely to fall into destructive 'groupthink' patterns and find creative, innovative solutions borne of different perspective and experience.

***Diverse companies perform better.***  Multiple studies have supported this conclusion.

***Homogenous companies are losing out on great talent.*** Per Nolan Caudill, "Our own upbringings, biases and life experiences result in referral networks that are very homogeneous" which means that a huge talent pool is being neglected.

***Diverse companies can better serve a diverse user base.*** This also seems intuitive to me... know your customer, represent your customer - in all ways!

### It’s the right thing to do.
